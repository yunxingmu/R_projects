The goal of this project is to discover biomarkers that are highly predictive of colorectal cancer treatment outcome. 
The datasets: Public Colorectal cancer patient data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/0df21a5f929a09596b2830c53bb5ffd5604a07cece7b389a41f3dd845b8408f2)
I combined the two datasets and my code contains the following: 1) data cleaning; 2) dimension reduction; 3)logistic regression; 4)linear regression; 5) Hypothesis testing and 6)predictive modeling.
